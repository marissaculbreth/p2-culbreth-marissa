# hamburger menu
I looked through multiple tutorials of how to do the hamburger menu and none of them were working on my end. I got it to work by writing out my own function without using the internet as a guide. Yay! I tried adding some padding on the list items but it was not working properly.

# Accordion on about page

I had a really hard time with the accordion. I tried using the example from class and my own knowledge but nothing was working. I went to the internet and tried like 5 different accordion markups. None worked until this one.

# Read more buttons on contact page
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_read_more.asp
I used this link to help me figure out how to write my HTML and JS for the read more buttons on the contact page. I'm really not sure why this is working as I have tried numerous different examples online and nothing seems to work.


# API element on contact page
I keep getting errors in the console that there's an unexpected token in at JS line 74 but I really do not know what what means or how to fix it since this was the template code that was available on the module page. I read numerous freecodecamp and stackoverflow posts with this issue and could not figure this out.
